# Breast Cancer Classification

This project aims to build machine learning models for classifying breast cancer tumors as malignant or benign using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains features computed from digitized images of fine needle aspirates (FNA) of breast masses. The goal is to predict the diagnosis of the tumor as either malignant (M) or benign (B).

## Files

- `breast_cancer_classification.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for building and evaluating machine learning models for breast cancer classification.
- `<yourname>_model_v1.py`: Python script that implements a logistic regression model for breast cancer classification.
- `README.md`: This file.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- scikit-learn

## Usage

1. Download the dataset from the provided URL and place it in the project directory.
2. Run the `breast_cancer_classification.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook or execute the `<yourname>_model_v1.py` script to train and evaluate the model.
3. The code will load the dataset, preprocess it, split it into training and testing sets, scale the features, train the model, make predictions, and evaluate the accuracy of the model.
4. The accuracy score and confusion matrix will be displayed in the output.

Feel free to explore different models, algorithms, and techniques to improve the classification performance.
